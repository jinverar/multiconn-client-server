#python TYPES This module defines utility functions to assist in dynamic creation of new types.
#It also defines names for some object types that are used by the standard Python interpreter, but not exposed as builtins like int or str are.
#Finally, it provides some additional type-related utility classes and functions that are not fundamental enough to be builtins.
